# ToDo-Project
There are two links on the navbar of this app. 
This app was developed by using ReactJS. 
There are two links used by react-router-dom. 
The First Link is Todo, where we enter the input and add our task. 
There is a delete button when the task is added, if we want to delete then delete that task.
The other Link is ALL Users which shows the details of users when we click on it it shows by calling the API. 
Two pages on that page show two apps for all users.
